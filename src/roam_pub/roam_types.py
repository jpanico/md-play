"""Foundational Roam Research type aliases and stub models.

Public symbols are organized into three groups:

- **Primitive type aliases**: :data:`Uid`, :data:`Id`, :data:`Order`, :data:`HeadingLevel`,
  :data:`PageTitle`, :data:`Url`, :data:`MediaType`.
- **Composite type aliases**: :data:`UidPair`, :data:`RawChildren`, :data:`RawRefs`,
