"""Roam Research normalized graph vertex model.

A :data:`Vertex` is the normalized (transcribed) form of a single
:class:`~roam_pub.roam_node.RoamNode`.  A :class:`VertexTree` is the normalized
form of a :class:`~roam_pub.roam_tree.NodeTree`.

Normalization (transcription) means:

- Datomic-internal numeric entity ids (:attr:`~roam_pub.roam_node.RoamNode.id`) are
  eliminated.
- Raw :class:`~roam_pub.roam_primitives.IdObject` stubs in ``children`` and ``refs`` are
  resolved to stable ``:block/uid`` strings.
- The raw ``string`` / ``title`` field distinction is collapsed into a single ``text``
  field.
- Each node is classified into a :class:`VertexType`.
- The result is self-contained and portable — no Datomic dependencies remain.

Normalization is performed by :func:`~roam_pub.roam_transcribe.transcribe` (for a full
:class:`~roam_pub.roam_tree.NodeTree`) or
:func:`~roam_pub.roam_transcribe.transcribe_node` (for a single
:class:`~roam_pub.roam_node.RoamNode`).

Public symbols:

- :data:`VertexChildren` — normalized form of
  :attr:`~roam_pub.roam_node.RoamNode.children`: ordered child UIDs.
- :data:`VertexRefs` — normalized form of :attr:`~roam_pub.roam_node.RoamNode.refs`:
  referenced UIDs.
- :class:`VertexType` — string enum classifying each vertex by the shape of its source
  :class:`~roam_pub.roam_node.RoamNode`.
- :class:`PageVertex` — normalized (transcribed) form of a Roam Page node.
- :class:`HeadingVertex` — normalized (transcribed) form of a Roam Heading block node.
- :class:`TextContentVertex` — normalized (transcribed) form of a plain-text Roam Block
  node.
- :class:`ImageVertex` — normalized (transcribed) form of a Roam Firestore image block
  node.
- :data:`Vertex` — union of all four concrete vertex types.
- :data:`vertex_adapter` — Pydantic :class:`~pydantic.TypeAdapter` for validating a
  :data:`Vertex` from a raw dict.
- :class:`VertexTree` — normalized (transcribed) form of a
  :class:`~roam_pub.roam_tree.NodeTree`; a portable tree of :data:`Vertex` instances.
- :meth:`VertexTree.dfs` — return a :class:`VertexTreeDFSIterator` for pre-order
  depth-first traversal.
- :class:`VertexTreeDFSIterator` — pre-order depth-first iterator over a
  :class:`VertexTree`.
