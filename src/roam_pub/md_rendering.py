"""Render a :class:`~roam_pub.graph.VertexTree` to a CommonMark document.

Converts the normalized vertex tree produced by
:func:`~roam_pub.roam_transcribe.transcribe` into a CommonMark string suitable
for further processing or direct publication.

Rendering rules:

- :class:`~roam_pub.graph.PageVertex` — rendered as an H1 heading
  (``# title``).
- :class:`~roam_pub.graph.HeadingVertex` — rendered as a CommonMark
  heading at the vertex's recorded level (``#`` … ``######``).
- :class:`~roam_pub.graph.TextContentVertex` — direct children of the
  page (depth 1) are rendered as paragraphs; deeper vertices are rendered as
  indented bullet-list items (``- text``, ``  - text``, …).
- :class:`~roam_pub.graph.ImageVertex` — rendered as a CommonMark image
  link (``![alt](url)``).

Public symbols:

- :func:`render` — render a :class:`~roam_pub.graph.VertexTree` to a
  CommonMark document string.
